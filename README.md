## Coupled Classical Oscillators

# Normal Mode Solver
tight_binding.py -- calculates the normal modes of a coupled oscillator system

This code calculates the normal modes, with the input parameters specified in an input text file. Currently, the code will plot the two normal modes of a coupled nanosphere dimer.
